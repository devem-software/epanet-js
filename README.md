[epanet-js](https://epanetjs.com) is a web application that makes [EPANET](https://www.epa.gov/water-research/epanet) accessible from the browser.

The project is a NextJS application built ontop of [Placemark](https://github.com/placemark/placemark). Although most of the logic occurs on the browser, it uses cloud functions to protect secrets and authenticate users.

‚è≥ **Future open source**
Each commit will become fully open source under the MIT license after **two years**. The FSL gives us space to keep innovating while ensuring that in time, everything we build is returned to the community as free and open source software.

This model helps prevent harmful free riding and keeps development sustainable. If you‚Äôre curious, you can read more about why we chose this approach on our [website](https://epanetjs.com/#why-we-built-epanet-js).

## Getting started

#### Install dependencies

```sh
pnpm install
```

##### Issues with Apple Silicon
We use the `node-canvas` library and the version we use does not include a packaged build for Apple Silicon. There is a build script available but `pnpm` does not launch it automatically. If you run into problems try the following:
1. Manually install the dependencies to run the build script [official documentation](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas/wiki/Installation%3A-Mac-OS-X)
2. Manually execute the `canvas` package build script
```sh
cd node_modules/canvas
npm run install
```

#### Configuration

Copy the contents from `.env.example` to `.env` and edit with the values from your accounts.

#### Dev server

You can start the dev server with the following command.

```sh
pnpm dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

_Notice: if you see a ChunkLoadError, try refreshing the page._

#### Run tests

```sh
pnpm test
```

Or in watch mode:

```sh
pnpm test:watch
```

#### Check types

```sh
pnpm check-types
```

Or in watch mode:

```sh
pnpm check-types:watch
```

#### Run linter

```sh
pnpm lint
```

#### Pre-commit hook

To prevent pushing code that has linter or types errors you can add to `.git/hooks/pre-commit` the following:

```
#!/bin/sh
echo "Running type check..."
pnpm run check-types || exit 1

echo "Running lint..."
pnpm run lint || exit 1

echo "‚úÖ All checks passed!"
```

## Deploy

You will need to configure the environment variables for the deployment. You can find the list of variables in `.env.example`.

To deploy you will need to run the `next build`.

In Vercel you can use this command:

```sh
pnpm lint && NODE_ENV=test pnpm test && NODE_ENV=production next build
```
